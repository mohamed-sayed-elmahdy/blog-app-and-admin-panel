### Blog App and Admin Panel

This project is built using **Next.js**, a React-based framework for building server-side rendered and static web applications.

### Step #1: Create a Next.js App

1. Open your integrated terminal in VS Code, To open the terminal in Visual Studio Code:

#### **Method 1: Using the Menu**

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the **View** menu in the top navigation bar.
3. Select **Terminal** from the dropdown.

#### **Method 2: Using a Keyboard Shortcut**

- Press **Ctrl + `** (backtick) on Windows/Linux or **Cmd + `** on macOS.  
  The backtick key (`) is usually located below the Esc key on your keyboard.

#### **What Happens Next?**

- A terminal window will appear at the bottom of the VS Code interface.

2. Run(write) the following command in the terminal to create a new Next.js app:

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest blog-app-and-admin-panel
   ```

   - **Explanation**:
     - `npx create-next-app@latest` initializes a Next.js project with the latest version.
     - `blog-app-and-admin-panel` is the name of the project.

3. After running the command, you will be prompted to:

   - **Select a TypeScript setup**: I chose **No**, as we won't use TypeScript in this app.
   - **Choose a template**: I selected **Tailwind CSS**, as we are using it for styling.
   - **Decide whether to use ESLint**: I chose **Yes** for ESLint configuration to ensure code quality.
   - **Enable the src directory**: I chose **Yes**, as it improves file organization and scalability for the project.
   - **Include the experimental app directory**: I chose **Yes**, to leverage the App Router for routing and layouts, enhancing flexibility and performance.
   - **Customize the default import alias (@/\*)**: I chose **Yes**, customizing the import alias to improve clarity and align with project structure.

4. Once you complete the prompts, a new folder named `blog-app-and-admin-panel` will be created. This folder will include:

   - **`app/`**: Contains the App Router setup, including default files like `page.js`.
   - **`public/`**: A folder for static assets like images, logOs.
   - **`styles/`**: Default CSS files such as `globals.css` and `tailwind.css`.
   - **`package.json`**: Includes scripts and dependencies, as shown:

     ```json
     {
       "name": "blog-app-and-admin-panel",
       "version": "0.1.0",
       "private": true,
       "scripts": {
         "dev": "next dev",
         "build": "next build",
         "start": "next start",
         "lint": "next lint"
       },
       "dependencies": {
         "react": "19.0.0-rc-66855b96-20241106",
         "react-dom": "19.0.0-rc-66855b96-20241106",
         "next": "15.0.3"
       },
       "devDependencies": {
         "postcss": "^8",
         "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
         "eslint": "^8",
         "eslint-config-next": "15.0.3"
       }
     }
     ```

   - **`node_modules/`**: Contains all dependencies required for the project.

5. Now Navigate into the project folder and open it in new vs code window

- to Navigate into the project folder

```bash
cd blog-app-and-admin-panel

```

- to open the project folder in a new vs code window

```bash
code .
```

Congratulations! You now have a fully functional Next.js app with the App Router setup, ready to customize.

### Step #2: Cleanup the Main Page and Global Styles

1. Open `app/page.js` and delete all the default content. Replace it with:

   ```jsx
   export default function Home() {
     return <h1>Welcome to Blog App and Admin Panel</h1>;
   }
   ```

2. Open `styles/globals.css` and clear all existing styles. Add this as the starting point:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

### Step #3: Open the Live Server

To start the live server for your app, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server starts, you should see output similar to this:

```bash
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

Alternatively, you can hold **Ctrl** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd** (macOS) and click on the link `http://localhost:3000` to open it directly in your browser.

You should see the message in our app:

**"Welcome to Blog App and Admin Panel"**

Congratulations! Your application is now running locally. ðŸŽ‰
**Note:** You can customize the content before or after running the live serverâ€”feel free to experiment!

Hereâ€™s how you can update **Step #4** to guide the user through changing `.js` files to `.jsx`:

### Step #4: Update this Files Extension `app/page.js` and `app/layout.js` to `.jsx` not `js`

If you're working with React components that use JSX syntax, it's a good practice to change the file extension from `.js` to `.jsx` to improve clarity and organization. Here's how you can do it:

1.  we will Rename the file from `page.js` to `page.jsx` to indicate that it contains JSX syntax.
    **To Rename in VS Code**:

- Right-click on the file in the file explorer in VC code and select **Rename**.
- Change the extension from `.js` to `.jsx`, and press **Enter**.

2. **Update Imports** :  
   If youâ€™ve renamed any files, make sure to update all imports that refer to that file. For example, if you renamed `page.js` to `page.jsx`, make sure to change all imports like this:

   ```js
   import Home from "./page"; // Old import (if it was 'page.js')
   ```

   To:

   ```js
   import Home from "./page.jsx"; // Updated import for 'page.jsx'
   ```

   in our case here `app/page.jsx` and `app/layout.jsx` aren't imported in anywhere so we won't update any imports

3. **Why Change to `.jsx`?**

   - **Clarity**: `.jsx` makes it clear that the file contains JSX syntax, improving code readability and organization.
   - **Tooling**: Some linters, code editors, or build tools may work more effectively with `.jsx` extensions, though modern tools like Webpack and Create React App generally handle `.js` files with JSX syntax just fine.

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully renamed your file to `.jsx` for better clarity and organization. ðŸŽ‰

### Step #5: Update the Title Displayed in the Browser Tab

To update the title of the application that appears in the browser tab, follow these steps:

1. Open the `app/layout.jsx`.

2. Locate the `title` propert in metadata object.

3. Add or modify the `title` the desired title for your app.

   For example:

   ```jsx
   export const metadata = {
     title: "Blog App and Admin Panel", // I add my title here that will show in browser tab
     description: "A powerful app for managing blogs and admin tasks", // I add my description here that will search result
   };

   export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body>{children}</body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

Then go to the live server in the browser you will see your tilte at the top

Congratulations! The title in your browser tab is now updated. ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to replace the title and description with content relevant to your project. ðŸ˜Š

### Step #6: Add the Outfit Font to Your Project

In this step, we'll integrate the **Outfit** font into your application and ensure the best performance and user experience by using `font-display: swap`. This will display text using a fallback font until the Outfit font has fully loaded, preventing any delay in showing content, Adding a custom Google font like Outfit enhances the visual appeal and typography of your app. Here's how you can do it:

#### Steps:

1. **Import the Outfit Font:**
   Start by importing the `Outfit` font from `next/font/google`. This utility allows you to seamlessly include Google Fonts in your project.

   ```javascript
   import { Outfit } from "next/font/google";
   ```

2. **Define the Outfit Font:**
   Create a constant for the `Outfit` font and Use the `Outfit` function to configure the font with subsets, weights, include the `display: "swap"` property in the configuration. This ensures that your app displays text immediately with a fallback font until the custom font loads.:

   ```javascript
   const outfit = Outfit({
     subsets: ["latin"],
     weight: ["400", "500", "600", "700"],
     display: "swap", // Enables text rendering with a fallback font while the Outfit font loads
   });
   ```

3. **Remove default Fonts (Optional):**
   maybe when you install a new next.js app you will find by default fonts like `geistSans` or `geistMono`, you can remove their imports and definitions, These fonts won't be needed anymore as we're switching to Outfit, in our current project we will remove their imports and definitions.

4. **Update the `<body>` Class:**
   Replace the font classes in the `<body>` tag with the `className` generated by the Outfit font configuration.

   **Before:**

   ```javascript
   <body className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}>
   ```

   **After:**

   ```javascript
   <body className={outfit.className}>
   ```

5. **Finalize the Code:**
   Hereâ€™s how your updated `app/layout.jsx` file should look after integrating the Outfit font with `font-display: swap`:

   ```javascript
   import { Outfit } from "next/font/google";
   import "./globals.css";

   const outfit = Outfit({
     subsets: ["latin"],
     weight: ["400", "500", "600", "700"],
     display: "swap",
   });

   export const metadata = {
     title: "StoryCraft",
     description:
       "Effortlessly create, customize, and manage your blogs with our advanced Blog App and Admin Panel. Designed for speed, flexibility, and user-friendly control to help you grow your online presence.",
   };

   export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
     return (
       <html lang="en">
         <body className={outfit.className}>{children}</body>
       </html>
     );
   }
   ```

6. **Verify in the Browser:**
   - Save your changes and restart the development server if necessary.
   - Open your application in the browser, and youâ€™ll notice the new **Outfit** font applied throughout your app.

#### **Why Use `font-display: swap`?**

Adding `display: "swap"` ensures that:

- Text is displayed immediately with a fallback font while the custom font is loading.
- Thereâ€™s no blank or invisible text (FOIT), improving the user experience.
- This practice is performance-friendly and aligns with SEO guidelines.

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You've successfully added the Outfit font to your project with `font-display: swap`. Your app now looks professional and loads efficiently for users!, Feel free to explore other font weights or styles to tailor your app's design to your needs. ðŸ˜Š

### Step #7: Set Up Folder Structure

In this step, we organized the project by creating a **`components`** folder and an **`assets`** folder in the `src` directory. This structure helps maintain clean, organized, and scalable code, especially as your project grows.

#### **Folder Structure Overview**

Hereâ€™s what we added to the `src` directory:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
```

---

#### **1. `components` Folder**

- **Purpose**: The `components` folder is used to store reusable React components. These components can be shared across the project, promoting modularity and consistency.

- **Examples of Components we will Add here**:
  - `Navbar.jsx` for a navigation bar.
  - `Footer.jsx` for the footer section.
  - `Button.jsx` for reusable button components.

---

#### **2. `assets` Folder**

- **Purpose**: The `assets` folder is where you store static files like images, logos, icons, or any other media used in the project.

- **Examples of Assets to Add**:
  - A `logo.png` file for the application logo.
  - Images for posts or articles.
  - Icons or SVG files used in the UI.

---

#### **Benefits of This Structure**

1. **Improved Organization**:

   - Separating components and assets makes it easier to locate files.

2. **Reusability**:

   - Having reusable components in one place promotes consistency and reduces redundant code.

3. **Scalability**:
   - As the project grows, this structure ensures clarity and avoids clutter in the codebase.

---

Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰  
Your project now has a structured folder setup that will make development smoother and more efficient.

### Step #8: Install the React-Icons Library to Use Its Icons in Our Project

Icons play a vital role in enhancing the UI/UX of any web application. To add icons easily, weâ€™ll use the **React-Icons** library, which provides a large collection of pre-built icons from popular icon packs.

---

#### **1. Install React-Icons**

Run the following command in your terminal to install the library:

```bash
npm install react-icons
```

---

#### **2. Why Use React-Icons?**

- **Variety**: Includes icons from popular libraries like FontAwesome, Material Design, Feather, and more.
- **Customizable**: Easy to style with CSS or inline styles.
- **Lightweight**: Only the icons you use are included in the final build.

---

#### **3. How to Use React-Icons**

1. **Import an Icon**:

   - After installation, you can import icons from the specific icon pack you want. For example, to import an icon from FontAwesome:
     ```jsx
     import { FaHome } from "react-icons/fa";
     ```

2. **Add the Icon to Your Component**:

   - Use the imported icon as a React component:
     ```jsx
     export default function Navbar() {
       return (
         <nav>
           <FaHome /> Home
         </nav>
       );
     }
     ```

3. **Style the Icon**:
   - Icons can be styled using inline styles, CSS classes or tailwind:
     ```jsx
     <FaHome style={{ color: "blue", fontSize: "24px" }} />
     ```

---

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully installed and set up the **React-Icons** library. Youâ€™re now ready to add beautiful icons to your application.

### Step #9: Create `Navbar.jsx` Component

In this step, weâ€™re designing the **Navbar**, which will act as a central navigation element for our application. 
The **Navbar** includes a logo, a "Get Start" button, and will later feature a **ThemeSwitch** icon for toggling 
between light and dark modes.

Let me First show you the **Final Output** then explain it to you step by step:

#### **Final Output**

The `Navbar` component structure looks like this:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Image from "next/image";
import { CiLocationArrow1 } from "react-icons/ci";
import Link from "next/link";

function Navbar() {
  return (
    <div className="py-3 px-5 md:px-12 lg:px-20 flex justify-between items-center border-b border-b-[var(--text)]">
      {/* Logo */}
      <Link href="/">
        <Image
          src="/logo.png"
          alt=""
          width={110}
          height={110}
          className="w-[110px] sm:w-auto"
        />
      </Link>
      {/* Button and ThemeSwitch Container*/}
      <div className="flex justify-center items-center gap-2 sm:gap-4">
        <button className="bg-[var(--secondary)] hover:bg-[var(--accent)] flex justify-center items-center  gap-1 sm:gap-2 py-1 px-3 sm:py-2 sm:px-6 rounded-md">
          Get Start
          <CiLocationArrow1 className="font-extrabold sm:text-2xl text-xl" />
        </button>
        {/* ThemeSwitch that we will create in the next steps will be here */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Navbar;
```

---

#### **What We Are Doing**

1. **Adding the Logo**:

   - We are using the `Image` component from Next.js to display a logo.
   - then we wrapped this image by `Link` Component to make this logo act as a link
   - Now This logo acts as a clickable link that redirects users to the homepage (`"/"`).

2. **Adding the "Get Start" Button**:

   - Weâ€™re creating a visually appealing button styled with Tailwind CSS.
   - The button uses an icon from the **React-Icons library** (`CiLocationArrow1`) for a modern look.
   - This button is styled to stand out and is intended to guide users to another page where they can **create a blog post** in the future.

3. **Preparing for the ThemeSwitch**:
   - Weâ€™ve left a placeholder comment(`ThemeSwitch`) under the button for a **ThemeSwitch component**, which will allow users to toggle between dark and light modes.
   - In the next steps, we will create this component and place its icon next to the "Get Start" button.

---

#### **Code Breakdown**

##### 1. **The Logo**

```jsx
<Link href="/">
  <Image
    src="/logo.png"
    alt=""
    width={110}
    height={110}
    className="w-[110px] sm:w-auto"
  />
</Link>
```

- The `Link` component wraps the logo and makes it clickable.
- The `Image` component ensures the logo is optimized and responsive.

##### 2. **The "Get Start" Button**

```jsx
<button className="bg-[var(--secondary)] hover:bg-[var(--accent)] flex justify-center items-center gap-1 sm:gap-2 py-1 px-3 sm:py-2 sm:px-6 rounded-md">
  Get Start
  <CiLocationArrow1 className="font-extrabold sm:text-2xl text-xl" />
</button>
```

- **Styling**:
  - We used Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.
  - The button background changes color when hovered (`hover:bg-[var(--accent)]`).
  - Padding, gaps, and rounded edges improve usability and aesthetics.
- **Icon**:
  - We added the arrow icon (`CiLocationArrow1`) from React-Icons to enhance the button's design.
- **Future Use**:
  - This button will be linked to a page where users can create a blog post.

---

By completing this step, youâ€™ve created a **functional and stylish Navbar** that provides navigation and prepares
for future features like theme switching. ðŸŽ‰

---

#### **Whatâ€™s Next?**

In **Step #10**, we will:

- Import This Navbar in The `layout.jsx` file to show this navabr in the whole application 

### step 10: Import This Navbar in The `layout.jsx` file to show this navabr in the whole application 

#### **1. Importing the Navbar Component**
In the `layout.jsx` file, you add this line of code: 

```javascript
import Navbar from "@/components/Navbar";
```

- **What This Does:**
  - This statement imports the `Navbar` component from the `components` folder.
  - The `@` symbol is an alias for the `src` directory in Next.js, making the import path shorter and more readable.

##### Why Did We Use the `@` Symbol Before the Path?

In our project, we added the `@` symbol before the import path, like this:

```javascript
import Navbar from "@/components/Navbar";
```

This is because during the setup process, we chose **Yes** when prompted to:

**"Customize the default import alias (@/*)"**

###### **Reason for Choosing Yes:**
1. **Improved Clarity**:
   - Using the `@` symbol makes import paths shorter and easier to read.
   - For example, instead of writing a long relative path like:
     ```javascript
     import Navbar from "../../components/Navbar";
     ```
     We can simply write:
     ```javascript
     import Navbar from "@/components/Navbar";
     ```

2. **Aligning with Project Structure**:
   - The `@` symbol is an alias for the `src` directory. This aligns imports with the structure of the project, making it more intuitive to locate files.

3. **Easier Refactoring**:
   - If you move files or folders, the `@` alias helps avoid issues with broken relative paths, simplifying the process of updating imports.
By customizing this setting, we enhanced our project's readability, maintainability, and scalability! 
---

#### **2. Why Import the Navbar in `layout.jsx`?**

- **Global Visibility**:
  - The `layout.jsx` file is the **root layout** for your application. Any component placed here, like the `Navbar`, will be displayed **on every page** of the app. This ensures the navbar is accessible wherever users navigate.

- **Consistency**:
  - Importing the `Navbar` here avoids duplicating its code in each individual page. This not only keeps the code clean but also ensures a consistent look and feel across the app.

- **Ease of Maintenance**:
  - If you ever need to update or modify the `Navbar`, you only need to edit the `Navbar` component in one place (`components/Navbar.jsx`). Changes will automatically apply to all pages.

- **User Experience**:
  - A persistent navbar allows users to quickly navigate between different parts of the app without scrolling or searching for navigation links.

- **Logical Placement**:
   - The `layout.jsx` file is specifically meant for defining shared UI elements like headers, footers, or navigation bars. The `Navbar` logically belongs here as part of the app's global structure.
---


#### **3.Where to Place the Navbar Component**

We placed the `Navbar` component in the `layout.jsx` file, specifically inside the `<body>` tag:

```jsx
export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
      <body className={outfit.className}>
        <Navbar /> {/* Puting the Navbar Component here will make the navbar show above other pages content */}
        {children}
        {/*And in the next steps will put the footer Component here*/}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```




**Final Explanation:**
By placing the Navbar in `layout.jsx`, it acts as a global header that will always appear at the top of every page in the application. This is a common approach in `Next.js` to create shared layouts.

### step #11: Apply Dark & light mode with no flicker
