Summary
This project uses `next-intl` without locale-based routing. The server-side helpers from `next-intl` are used in `src/app/layout.jsx` and `src/i18n/request.js` to resolve locale and messages and to provide messages to the client via `NextIntlClientProvider`.

Strengths
- Uses `next-intl` server helpers (`getLocale`, `getMessages`) in the app router root layout. This is the recommended pattern for the app directory.
- Keeps translations in JSON files under `src/messages/`, which is a familiar, simple shape and is easy to edit.
- The implementation reads a locale preference from a cookie which makes user preference persistent across requests.
- The `html` tag receives a `lang` attribute from the resolved locale — good for accessibility and SEO.


   
2) caching and performance considerations
   - Dynamic importing of JSON on every request will use the Node module cache in server environments, but file lookup and ESM resolution still happen per request. There’s no explicit caching layer or memoization for message bundles in `request.js`.
   - For many locales and many messages the current approach can increase cold-start or first-load latency.

3) missing explicit plugin/locales configuration
   - `next.config.mjs` calls `createNextIntlPlugin()` with default options and `nextConfig` empty. That works but misses an opportunity to centralize supported locales and default locale in a single canonical place.

4) NextIntlClientProvider usage
   - In `src/app/layout.jsx`, `NextIntlClientProvider` is called with `messages` but no explicit `locale` prop. While `messages` may be sufficient, passing both `locale` and `messages` is clearer and more explicit.

Suggestions (actionable)
I’ve grouped suggestions into correctness fixes, performance/improvements, structure, and security. Each item is actionable and low-risk.

Correctness
- Fix the import path and ensure `locale` is a string. In `src/i18n/request.js` compute and return a string locale (e.g. `const locale = localeFromCookie && supported.includes(localeFromCookie) ? localeFromCookie : defaultLocale;`) and use a relative import path that resolves reliably, for example `await import('../messages/' + locale + '.json')` or an absolute path starting at `src/messages` depending on your bundler configuration. Avoid interpolating an array into the import path.
- Make `request.js` return `locale` as a string. `getRequestConfig` expects the resolved locale for message lookups and downstream helpers like `getMessages` expect a string.

Performance and scalability
- Add a small server-side cache (in-memory) or memoization for message bundles to avoid repeated resolution and import overhead on high-traffic apps. Example approaches:
  - Use a simple module-level Map keyed by locale that stores the imported messages. Because ESM imports are cached, this is mostly useful to avoid repeated dynamic import resolution overhead and to provide a stable reference.
  - For large-scale deployments (serverless / cold starts), consider bundling message files into the server build (keep them as static imports where possible) or use Next.js internationalized routing to allow static generation per-locale.
- Consider lazy-loading only missing message namespaces if you split messages by page/feature to reduce payload size for each request.

File/folder structure and maintainability
- Keep messages together in a clear folder. I recommend moving `src/messages/` to `src/i18n/messages/` or vice versa so that `src/i18n/request.js` can import with a clear relative path (e.g. `../messages/en.json`). The important bit is proximity and obvious naming.
- Centralize supported locales and default locales in one module so both `next.config.mjs` (plugin config) and `src/i18n/request.js` import the same canonical list. Example: `src/i18n/config.js` export `supportedLocales` and `defaultLocale`.
- If you plan to grow beyond 2–3 locales, split message JSON into namespaces (e.g., `common.json`, `home.json`, `admin.json`) and dynamically load only what’s needed.

Security and cookie best practices
- Decide whether the locale cookie must be readable by client JavaScript:
  - If you set the cookie from the server and want it protected from XSS, set it HttpOnly and manage switching via server endpoints (POST to change preference). But HttpOnly cookies cannot be read by browser JS, so client-side UI that immediately updates to the new locale would need to call the server to confirm change or re-render after the server sets the cookie.
  - If you need client-side control (e.g., locale switcher updates before navigation), you will store a non-HttpOnly cookie. In that case, mitigate tampering by validating the cookie value server-side against your `supportedLocales` whitelist before using it (this is already done but keep it strict).
- Ensure cookies are set with Secure (in production), SameSite=strict or Lax depending on cross-site needs, and a reasonable maxAge. Example attributes: Secure; SameSite=Lax; path=/; max-age=31536000; (set Secure only in HTTPS production).

Best-practice code sketch (non-breaking small changes)
- Canonicalize locales and safe import (pseudocode):
  - create `src/i18n/config.js` that exports `supportedLocales = ['en','ar']` and `defaultLocale='en'`;
  - update `src/i18n/request.js` to return a string `locale` and import relatively: `const messages = (await import('../messages/' + locale + '.json')).default;` and return { locale, messages }.
- Set `NextIntlClientProvider` explicitly with `locale` and `messages` in `src/app/layout.jsx`.

Quality gates and verification notes
- Quick validation steps you can run after small edits:
  1) Build the app locally (`next build`) and run (`next start`) to confirm there are no module resolution errors.
  2) Test switching locale in the running app and watch the server logs for any import resolution errors.
  3) Verify cookie attributes in the browser devtools to ensure Secure/SameSite are applied in production.

Requirements coverage
- All requested files were reviewed and recommendations were provided. (Done)

Next steps I can take (pick one)
- I can open a small patch to:
  1) make `locale` a string in `src/i18n/request.js`, fix the import path, and memoize message imports, plus update `src/app/layout.jsx` to pass `locale` into `NextIntlClientProvider`.
  2) add a tiny `src/i18n/config.js` for canonical locales and update `next.config.mjs` to import and use it.

If you want, tell me which of the two patches above to apply and I will implement and run a quick validation build.
