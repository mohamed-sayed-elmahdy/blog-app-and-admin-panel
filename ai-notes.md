## Issues


1. Repeated loading of messages on server-side

   - Problem: `generateMetadata` and `RootLayout` both call `getMessages(locale)` (and `getLocale`) independently and load messages twice per request. This duplicates work and increases latency.
   - Files: `src/app/layout.jsx`

2. Dynamic import & caching of message files (server)

   - Problem: `src/i18n/request.js` imports messages dynamically per request: `await import(
   ../messages/${locale}.json)`. While dynamic import works, it can be optimized: Node/module cache may help but there's no explicit caching strategy. In high-traffic or serverless environments extra imports per-request may add latency.
   - Files: `src/i18n/request.js`

3. Use of `await cookies()` in server code (API misuse)

   - Problem: `cookies()` from `next/headers` returns a RequestCookies object synchronously; awaiting it is unnecessary and suggests a misunderstanding. It's a minor correctness issue and can be cleaned up.
   - Files: `src/i18n/request.js`

4. Duplicate locale list and lack of central config

   - Problem: Supported locales are defined in `src/i18n/request.js` only. `next.config.mjs` does not provide locale config to `next-intl` plugin. This duplication leads to drift and makes it harder to maintain supported locales in one place.
   - Files: `src/i18n/request.js`, `next.config.mjs`

5. Next-Intl plugin not configured

   - Problem: `next.config.mjs` calls `createNextIntlPlugin()` without options. That forfeits build-time optimizations the plugin provides (message routing/bundling) and doesn't document available locales and defaultLocale centrally.
   - Files: `next.config.mjs`

6. Metadata locale value empty and inconsistent metadata sources

   - Problem: `src/messages/en.json` and `ar.json` contain `metadata.openGraph.locale` as an empty string. `generateMetadata` uses `messages['metadata']` but the messages files include placeholder/empty fields and mismatched authors. This can lead to incorrect SEO metadata and inconsistent content.
   - Files: `src/messages/en.json`, `src/messages/ar.json`, `src/app/layout.jsx`

7. Caching and CDN cache key issues (server-side rendering)

    - Problem: When rendering localized pages without locale-based routing, caching layers or CDNs may serve an HTML response generated for one locale to users with a different locale unless cache keys vary by cookie value. There's no handling or guidance in the code to vary caches by the locale cookie.
    - Files: `src/i18n/request.js`, `src/components/ui/ToggleLocal.jsx`

8. Minor accessibility/UX issues

    - Problem: Toggle input has `sr-only` and `aria-*` attributes which is good, but there is no keyboard focus styling (the input is visually hidden) and no explicit label text for screen readers beyond `aria-label`. Also the toggle keyboard interaction uses the native checkbox but visual knob translation may be reversed; this impacts discoverability and keyboard users.
    - Files: `src/components/ui/ToggleLocal.jsx`


## Solutions

For each issue above, actionable steps are listed below. Apply these incrementally and test locally.

1) Deduplicate message loading in `layout.jsx`

   Actionable fixes:
   - Fetch messages once per request and re-use them for both `generateMetadata` and `RootLayout`. In the App Router you can compute messages in `RootLayout` and pass them down, but `generateMetadata` is a separate function; instead create a small helper that both call which uses a request-scoped/memoized cache.

   Implementation steps:
   - Create `src/i18n/server.js` with helpers `getLocaleFromRequest()`, `getMessagesForLocale(locale)` that memoize per-request (or at least per server process) using a Map. Example: `const messagesCache = new Map();`.
   - Import those helpers in `layout.jsx` and call the helper from both `generateMetadata` and `RootLayout`. Keep the helper cheap and safe (validate locale before importing file).

2) Cache message imports on the server

   Actionable fixes:
   - Add a small in-memory cache (Map) inside `src/i18n/request.js` (or `src/i18n/server.js`) keyed by locale to avoid dynamic imports on every request. For serverless, caching helps inside the warm container; add a note that cold starts will still import at least once.
   - Keep the safety check validating locale against `SUPPORTED_LOCALES` before importing to avoid path injection.

   Implementation steps:
   - Wrap the dynamic import with: if (cache.has(locale)) return cache.get(locale); else import and store in cache.
   - Example cache TTL/eviction is optional; keep simple Map for now.

3) Remove unnecessary `await` for `cookies()` and tidy server code

   Actionable fixes:
   - Replace `const store = await cookies();` with `const store = cookies();` in `src/i18n/request.js`.
   - Use `store?.get(LOCALE_COOKIE_NAME)?.value` directly, and fall back to header `Accept-Language` if cookie missing (optional improvement).

   Implementation steps:
   - Update `src/i18n/request.js` to read cookie synchronously.

4) Centralize supported locales and default locale

   Actionable fixes:
   - Create `src/i18n/config.js` with `SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, `DEFAULT_LOCALE`, `LOCALE_COOKIE_NAME`. Import this single source of truth wherever used.
   - Update `next.config.mjs` to use the same list (pass it into the plugin config) so that build-time tooling and server runtime agree.

   Implementation steps:
   - Add `src/i18n/config.js` export.
   - Update `next.config.mjs` to import from that file or duplicate the list there (note: `next.config.mjs` is executed at build time; if importing local project code is awkward, keep a small duplication but ensure it's based on environment variables or comments to keep in sync).

5) Configure `next-intl` plugin with locales and defaultLocale

   Actionable fixes:
   - Pass `locales` and `defaultLocale` to `createNextIntlPlugin({ locales, defaultLocale })` in `next.config.mjs` to let the plugin generate optimized bundles and give a central location for supported locales.

   Implementation steps:
   - Update `next.config.mjs` to:
     - import or declare the locales array
     - call `createNextIntlPlugin({ locales: ['en','ar'], defaultLocale: 'en' })`

6) Fix metadata values in message files

   Actionable fixes:
   - Populate `metadata.openGraph.locale` with the correct locale string (`en` or `ar`) in `src/messages/*.json`.
   - Keep metadata fields consistent: either generate `authors` and `openGraph` from application code (recommended) or ensure translations include only translatable strings (title, description) and avoid repeating structured metadata that can drift.

   Implementation steps:
   - Update `src/messages/en.json` and `src/messages/ar.json` to set `openGraph.locale` appropriately.
   - In `generateMetadata`, prefer using a small mapper to build canonical metadata from messages rather than trusting the entire `metadata` object from translation files.

7) Avoid CDN cache poisoning by varying on locale cookie

    Actionable fixes:
    - For any CDN or caching layer that caches HTML, ensure the cache key varies by the locale cookie (or by a simpler header). At minimum set the `Vary: Cookie, Accept-Language` header for server responses that depend on cookie-based locale.
    - Consider moving to locale-based routing (e.g., `/en`, `/ar`) which works better with CDNs and caches because URLs differ per-locale and caches naturally split.

    Implementation steps:
    - Implement a lightweight `middleware.js` that sets `res.headers.append('Vary', 'Cookie, Accept-Language')` or use `NextResponse` in middleware to set headers for HTML responses. Document behavior and test with your CDN.
    - Alternatively, evaluate switching to Next.js i18n routing which avoids cookie-dependent cache splits.

8) Accessibility and UX improvements for toggle

    Actionable fixes:
    - Keep `aria-label`, but also include a visually hidden text label linked to the input via `aria-labelledby` or `<label>` markup to improve screen reader clarity.
    - Ensure the toggle is focusable and has visible focus outlines for keyboard users. Instead of `sr-only`, consider using `className="peer sr-only focus:not-sr-only"` patterns or adding focus styles to a wrapper when the input is focused using `peer-focus:*`.
    - Avoid reversing the knob incorrectly for RTL: read `document.documentElement.dir` or the messages `lang` to adapt knob transform.

    Implementation steps:
    - Add `peer` to the input (see item 3) and `peer-focus:ring` or similar to the knob wrapper.
    - Add a hidden label or `aria-labelledby` for the input and test with a screen reader.


Additional optional improvements (performance & maintainability):

- Build-time message extraction: Consider converting translations into a structure that `next-intl` plugin can statically analyze and bundle (the plugin helps with this when properly configured). This reduces runtime dynamic imports.

- Server helpers & small test: Add `src/i18n/server.js` with unit tests that verify that `getMessagesForLocale` returns expected keys for supported locales and throws/returns default for unsupported locales.

- Documentation: Add a short `docs/i18n.md` describing the flow: how the cookie is used, where to add new locales, and the cookie naming convention.

If you want, I can implement the low-risk edits now (create `src/i18n/config.js`, add message cache in `src/i18n/request.js`, and update `ToggleLocal.jsx` for peer/freshness).

Verification note: I confirmed the project now uses `LOCALE_COOKIE_NAME` in `ToggleLocal.jsx` when reading and writing the cookie, and the server code accepts `await cookies()` for Next.js 15. The cookie policy was changed to `SameSite=Lax` per your decision.
